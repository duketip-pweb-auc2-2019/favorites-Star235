                 Supergirl is a movie series about a girl born with powers that comes from another planet <br>
                 called Krypton. The movie series is about a little girl named Kara that had arrived second<br> from  
                 escaping a deadly explosion. Long story short, after arriving to Earth, Kara keeps her <br>powers a

                    There are many amazing characters in Supergirl, but my favorites are; Kara Zor-El and Alex
                    Danvers. Both characters play a big role in the show and are in most of the scenes that 
                    have to do with combat. Although there are other great characters in this movie like Matian
                    Manhunter, I would have to say that Kara and Alex are my favorites.
